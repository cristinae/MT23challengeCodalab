<h2>Way&uacute;unaiki to Spanish translation</h2>

<p>Way&uacute;unaiki is the native language spoken in the Way&uacute;u community, located in the Caribbean region connecting Colombia and Venezuela, where the language coexists with Spanish. In this challenge we want to create translation resources for the Way&uacute;u community.</p>

<h3>The shared task</h3>

<p><strong>Phase I, development</strong>: We provide training data extracted from the Tatoeba challenge [1,2]. It mostly belongs to the relogious domain. We substracted a set from the original Tatoeba corpus: the in-domain test set that is going to be used for evaluating your MT engine in this phase. Together with the parallel corpus we provide, you can use any other data you can find to train your MT engine, but please, don&#39;t use the original Tatoeba corpus which would also contain the test set. Upload the translation into Spanish of the test set to Codalab. The translation will be evaluated using BLEU, TER, chrF and COMET. chrF is the official evaluation metric of the challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Phase II, evaluation</strong>: We provide an out-of-domain test set (general domain) in Way&uacute;unaiki and you will have a week to upload its translation into Spanish to Codalab. The translation will be evaluated using BLEU, TER, chrF and COMET but only chrF is the official evaluation metric of the challenge. Notice that the best system in an in-domain test set is not necessarily the best system in a general domain.</p>

<h3>What can you do?</h3>

<p><strong>Baseline</strong>: You can reproduce the SMT and/or the NMT system developed in class. Finetuning the NMT hyperparameters is relevant</p>

<p><strong>Data</strong>: The training data is not clean at all and it is insuficent. Can you improve on that?</p>

<p><strong>Languages</strong>: Spanish in this dataset comes from Latin America. Wayuu is an aglutinative language while Spanish is a fusional language. Can you easy the training in such a difficult context?</p>

<p><strong>Advanced</strong>: Multilingualism. Any other language pair with data available that can help with joint training? Any close language even monolingually?</p>
