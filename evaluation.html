<h2>Submission and Evaluation</h2>

</br>
<p> The challenge is only evaluated with automatic metrics. We will use BLEU, TER, chrF (sacreBLEU versions) and COMET. chrF is the official evaluation metric. COMET might be misleading as it does not include Way√∫u (but it does Spanish). When submitting a run, be patient, COMET runs on CPU. It might take 20 minutes before your results appear in the leaderboard.</p>
